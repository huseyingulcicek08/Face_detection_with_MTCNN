<h3>Introduction:</h3>
As you know Python programming language has great significance in the world of computer vision. Face detections is a live application of computer vision you may have used it in your daily life for example face unlock, autofocus and snapchat filters. In this article, I will explain how one can use face detection using pre rained MTCNN model.

There are many face detection algorithms such as Haar-feature based cascade classifiers, HOG, and MTCN for more information you can go for this <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/whats-the-difference-between-haar-feature-classifiers-and-convolutional-neural-networks-ce6828343aeb">article</a>
<h3>Install these requirements:</h3>
<pre><span id="pip-command">pip install mtcnn</span></pre>
